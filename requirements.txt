🤖 AI Video Content Relevance Evaluator

This project is a Streamlit web application that uses the Gemini AI to analyze a YouTube video's transcript. It determines how relevant the video's content is to a given title and description, providing a "Relevance Score" and other key insights.

🚀 Core Features

Relevance Scoring: Get an instant "Relevance Score" (0-100%) that compares the video's transcript to your title and description.

AI-Powered Justification: An AI-generated explanation for why the video received its score.

Content Flagging: Automatically flags videos with "Irrelevant Segments" (like sponsorships or off-topic rants).

Key Insights: Automatically extracts the "Top 5 Key Points" and a "Quarterly Summary" (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) of the video.

Category Tags: The AI suggests relevant tags (e.g., Tech, Education, How-to) for the video's content.
